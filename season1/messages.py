MESSAGES_S1_WELCOME = [
"""# Welcome to Season 1, Gamers

We are proud to introduce to you Season 1 of the DSA S4 Wirk Online Gaming Community!
We hope you will enjoy participating over the next few weeks, and maybe win some prizes and bragging rights along the way!
""",
"""## How does it work?

Season 1 will last a total of roughly 10 weeks, starting from 4th March 2024 until 12th May 2024.
Over the course of the Season, you will be given various opportunities to earn Season Points.
These can be earned through participating in competitions, being active in the server, and winning tournaments!

At the end of the Season, the Top 3 players with the highest points will be awarded a small voucher for a Games store of their Choice (Steam, Xbox, PS, or similar).
Although there is a prize, we encourage you all to participate in all events and competitions regardless, and hope this system can be a small motivation for you to get involved, or at least outperform your company rivals :wink:.
""",
"""## How can I earn points?

There is a maximum possible score of 1000 points that can be earned, if you manage to participate in every event, utilise every single score multiplier and bonus, and win every single competition.
Not an easy feat!
But just being involved will get you a long way: there are over 300 points available just by taking part in every event and challenge.
