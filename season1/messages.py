MESSAGES_S1_WELCOME = [
"""# Welcome to Season 1, Gamers

We are proud to introduce to you Season 1 of the DSA S4 Wirk Online Gaming Community!
We hope you will enjoy participating over the next few weeks, and maybe win some prizes and bragging rights along the way!
""",
"""## How does it work?

Season 1 will last a total of roughly 10 weeks, with the exact start date to be confirmed (will be in the next week or two!).
Over the course of the Season, you will be given various opportunities to earn Season Points.
These can be earned through participating in competitions, being active in the server, and winning tournaments!

At the end of the Season, the Top 3 players with the highest points will be awarded a small voucher for a Games store of their Choice (Steam, Xbox, PS, or similar).
Although there is a prize, we encourage you all to participate in all events and competitions regardless, and hope this system can be a small motivation for you to get involved, or at least outperform your company rivals :wink:.
""",
"""## How can I earn points?

There is a maximum possible score of 1000 points that can be earned, if you manage to participate in every event, utilise every single score multiplier and bonus, and win every single competition.
Not an easy feat!
But just being involved will get you a long way: there are over 300 points available just by taking part in every event and challenge.
""",
"""## Events

Events will be announced some time before they begin, with Season Points up for grabs also described.
Check the [#news](https://discord.com/channels/691656646384156783/1205540821810675752) channel, or the Events tab for new events!

    """# Hello World!

Good Evening Gamers!
It's a new year, and the Online Gaming Social Clubs of DSA, S4 and Wirk have decided to put aside their competitive differences, and join forces to create a more organised, involved, and hopefully fun community for us all!

We've already implemented some changes, and have a few things planned for the upcoming future.
""",
"""## Server Makeover

As you may have noticed, the server has had a bit of a makeover.
Some things you can already see:
### Focused Channels and Content

We have introduced channels specific for different types of content.
This includes:

* Dedicated channels for [news](https://discord.com/channels/691656646384156783/1205540821810675752), [info](https://discord.com/channels/691656646384156783/1205540718823612477), [role assignment](https://discord.com/channels/691656646384156783/1205540890689671198), other boring stuff.
* Centralised Social channels for [text chat](https://discord.com/channels/691656646384156783/691656646384156786), [voice chat](https://discord.com/channels/691656646384156783/1205541385051312208), and of course the [spicey memes](https://discord.com/channels/691656646384156783/691659994357301318).
* Game-Specific channels and content: Self-select player roles in the [roles channel](https://discord.com/channels/691656646384156783/1205540890689671198) to get updates about patch notes and more, specific for each game.
* Links to the current free games on [Epic Games](https://discord.com/channels/691656646384156783/1205542033628856320) and [Steam](https://discord.com/channels/691656646384156783/1205542074582179850)
* And more! Do some exploring and see what else you can find ;)
""",
"""## Upcoming Events

In the next week or so, we will announce our first ever Community Event - ***Season 1 of the OGSC.***
This will feature a range of events and competitions (some smaller, some BIGGER) over the course of around 10 weeks.
Participating in these events will earn you Season Points, and winning them will earn you even more.
The players who earn the most Season Points at the end of the season will be rewarded with a small prize, and entry is free! So you have nothing to lose :)

More info on the Season and Events in general will be provided as the time approaches.
""",
"""## So What Now?

We are still in the process of rolling stuff out, but want to get everyone informed of whats to come as soon as possible!
Feedback is always welcome, feel free to make comments in the [#feedback](https://discord.com/channels/691656646384156783/1205547775706669166) channel, this will be the primary place we monitor for feedback.
Please don't reply to OGSC Assistant, he is a little slow and doesn't know how to read his messages.
Maybe this will change in the future... 

Hope you're all as excited as we are! And see you all online ;)

The OGSC Admin Team
