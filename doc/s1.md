# Welcome to Season 1, Gamer

We are proud to introduce to you Season 1 of the DSA S4 Wirk Online Gaming Community!
We hope you will enjoy participating over the next few week and maybe win some games and prizes along the way!

## How does it work?

Season 1 will last a total of roughly 10 weeks, starting from 4th March 2024 until 12th May 2024.
Over the course of the Season, you will be given various opportunities to earn Points.
These can be earned through participating in competitions, being active in the server, and winning tournaments!

At the end of the Season, the Top 3 players with the highest points will be awarded a small voucher for a Games store of their Choice (Steam, Xbox, PS, or similar).
Although there is a prize, we encourage you all to participate in all events and competitions regardless, and hope this system can be a small motivation for you to get involved, or at least outperform your company rivals :wink:.

## How can I earn points?

There is a maximum possible score of 1000 points that can be earned, if you manage to participate in every event, utilise every single score multiplier and bonus, and win every single competition.
Not an easy feat!
But just being involved will get you a long way: there are around 300 points available just by taking part in every event and challenge.

All of the ways you can earn points can be seen [here]().

 - Total: 100 points available

### DWSOG Survey

So, we are all a little new to this, and we are also not exactly sure how we want to plan things in the future.
To help us know what you like and what we can do to make the server the best it can possibly be for you, we have prepared a short survey to ask you about what games you play, what kinds of events you are interested in, etc.
The survey will also be the most important influencing decision for which games are played in the Season 1 Tournaments.
So, let your voice be heard, and be rewarded for your time with some sweet points :)

Points:
 - 50 points: Complete the Survey
 - Total: 50 points available

### Weekly Meme competition
