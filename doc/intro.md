# Welcome

Hey there, and welcome to the DSA / S4 / Wirk gaming server! We are so glad you are here :partying_face:

To get the most out of the server, please keep on reading, and see what you can do for your server, and what your server can do for you!

## News

News, announcements, events and competitions will be posted in the [#news](https://discord.com/channels/691656646384156783/1205540821810675752).
Keep an eye out to see what is going on in the server!

## Events

Events will appear from time to time, when we are running competitions, or planning tournaments, etc.
There will appear in the top left of your Discord window, and information specific to each event will be provided on the event page.

## Roles

Visit the [#roles](https://discord.com/channels/691656646384156783/1205540890689671198) channel, and get some shiny new roles to adjust what you can see in the server, and how you appear to other users.

## Suggestions 

If you have any suggestions for the server (ideas for an event, you want a specific channel for your favourite game, etc.) feel free to write a message in the [#suggestions](https://discord.com/channels/691656646384156783/1205547775706669166) channel, or react to suggestions there to show your support.
If a suggestion gets enough interest, we will be happy to implement anything we can :smile:.

## Surveys

In order for us to plan and organise the best server possible, it helps us a lot to know what you want from it!
What games you play, what kinds of events you are interested in, etc.
So please keep an eye out for announcements for these and give us that sweet sweet feedback.

## Chat

General discussion can be posted in the [#chat](https://discord.com/channels/691656646384156783/691656646384156786) channel.

For some very popular games with a lot of activity, there are also some dedicated text channels, patch note bots, etc.
See if anything pops up when you choose the player role for your favourite game!

If you just wanna hang out, you probably wanna be in [#hanging-out](https://discord.com/channels/691656646384156783/1205541385051312208).
